The project contains two application for tweet data analysis on Spark.

Usually for most analysis, there is a source of data, thus for this case, a simple scala application was written to extract tweets given a particular tag.

Beyond getting the data, there is the need to then analyze the data, for this case, we used spark for analysis on the tweet data.

Spark application in a Build, Run and Package approach, this is oftentimes possible when using IDE as that InteliJ.
However, in cases you are using Scala Interpreter, where you can then build your scala projects using a notebook, it's uusually good to use an Already deployed cluster environement such as Databricks.

I have added Intelij Idea based Compile and run code in the sparkProject folder.
However, to view the project on Databricks, Kindly click on the following link:
